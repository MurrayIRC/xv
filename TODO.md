# TODO

* figure out how to solve the issue of holding all of the "world" data
** should a worldspace have a list of entities within it?
*** probably not, since if something is stacked it can become its own "stack" entity containing a list
** should a worldspace only have one entity per space? how is this reconciled with free movement?

* should we distinguish between "fixed" grid objects and "free moving" items, npcs, players?
